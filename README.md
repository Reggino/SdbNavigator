* Fire up Google Chrome and the plugin
* Open a new tab
* Sign in for your AWS amazon account at https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key
* Copy and paste the "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access Key" into the corresponding fields on the plugin-page
* Choose your nearest Region.
* Click connect
* Now choose a domain on the left-hand side, or create a new one.
* Add some properties to the selected domain (if they could not be retrieved by scanning existing records)
* Start adding new records using the defined properties
